It’s quick to set up and easy to edit what the text says even after you’ve created the animation. Plus, you can save the animation as a preset so you can easily reuse it on any text layer, in any After Effects project; no need to recreate or even import anything. You can even share text animation presets with others.</p><p>What you’ll learn:\\n    How text animators work\\n    What different text animator options and controllers do\\n    What Selector Shapes do and how to animate with the Range Selector\\n    What properties can be animated\\n    How to adjust easing on text animators\\n    How to use multiple text animators for more complex animations\\n    When to use the Wiggly Selector\\n    How to make text 3D (using After Effects)\\n    How to save your custom text animators as a preset\\nPlus, I’ll show you 8 different examples that demonstrate a wide range of possibilities. Using what you learn, you’ll be able to create your own unique text animations.</p><p>Included with this class:\\n    An After Effects project file with guides to help you visualize what different text animator options and controllers do\\n    6 text animator presets\\n    \\nWho this class is for:\\nText animators work a little differently than other types of animation in After Effects. This means that if you already have experience with After Effects animation, but haven’t touched text animators, you’ll get a lot out of this class. It also means that you don’t need to know a ton about After Effects to be successful. Before taking this class you should know some After Effects basics like how to create a composition and set keyframes.</p>",\n  "credentials": {\n    "username": "studio@theonlinestudio.co.uk",\n    "password": "ch4rl0tt3"\n  },\n  "courseContent": [\n    "---------------------------------------"\n  ]\n}	https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/Text-Animators-Custom-Text-Animation-in-Adobe-After-Effects/1739980266?via=search-layout-grid	{}	LINK	https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/icons/aftereffects.svg	cm5mv1fvj0036djyka2842mc8	2023-07-28 00:00:00	2025-01-08 10:55:02.481

Learn 11 different expressions to automate animations, eliminate excessive keyframes, achieve complex effects, and work more efficiently; no programming experience needed!</p><p>An expression is a short block of code, written in JavaScript that modifies an animatable property. Expressions can be useful in many different cases in motion design:\\n    Create continuous, repetitive, or reactive motion\\n    Automate animations\\n    Avoid excessive keyframes\\n    Set up rigs</p><p>This class covers 11 different expressions so you can understand what they do and how to use them, without actually needing to learn how to write JavaScript. Plus, I’ll provide examples of how I use expressions in real projects. You’ll be able to start using these expressions in your animations to work more efficiently and achieve effects that would have been extremely tedious or impossible before.</p><p>In future classes, once you’ve gotten comfortable using these expressions in your work, you can move on to learning how to write your own expressions. This class is a perfect intro into the advanced topic of expressions which can open up a whole new, customisable side of Adobe After Effects.</p><h4>Who this class is for:</h4><p>This class is for motion designers who are comfortable with the basics of Adobe After Effects and want to take their workflow to the next level.
